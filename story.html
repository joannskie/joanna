               <p>I wanted to be involved in a project that gives the little kids in the streets an 
                  opportunity to learn on how to write, read, and count a number. Wherein this 
                  project aims to help the less fortunate kids to learn even though they are not 
                  going in school. I wanted to be a role model for the little kids so that when they 
                  are capable to help other people, they would do that without thinking twice. If I 
                  would face a problem in this project in the future, i think it would be financial 
                  problems, and the solution that i would do is I will ask for a donation from those I 
                  know who are already capable in life to help the little kids.

                  Article 1: The Balancing Act: Life as a Working Student
               </h3>
               <p class="pb-5 wow fadeInLeft">
                  Being a student is a rigorous experience in and of itselfâ€”juggling lectures, 
                  assignments, exams, and social life can push anyone to their limits. As a working 
                  student, I have realized that this dual position takes more than simply time 
                  management skills; it needs resilience, dedication, and a willingness to sacrifice 
                  some things to achieve others. Time is one of the most immediate obstacles for a 
                  working student. With classes, study sessions, and work hours, it seems like there 
                  is never enough time to do everything.                 <br><br>
                  For example, when a test is approaching and 
                  your work shift coincides with your revision time, it is easy to become 
                  overwhelmed. Sleep deprivation has become more common, and as a result, mental 
                  and physical energy levels are often low. Missing sleep becomes a frequent 
                  occurrence, and as a result, mental and physical vitality is often depleted. It is also 
                  difficult to be present in both domains                    <br><br>
                  At work, I may be focused on finishing a task 
or assisting a customer, but my mind is constantly racing with thoughts of the 
forthcoming exam or assignment deadlines. Similarly, while studying, I cannot help 
but think about the work-related obligations I still need to attend to. This frequent 
flipping between roles can produce mental tiredness because I am always shifting 
gears between the two worlds.<br><br>
Despite these obstacles, there are indisputable 
benefits to being a working student. The most obvious advantage is financial 
independence. Having a job not only helps pay for tuition, books, and living 
expenses, but it also relieves the burden of relying only on student loans or family 
assistance. This financial independence is quite powerful.
